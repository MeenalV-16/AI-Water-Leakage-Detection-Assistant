# AI Water Leakage Detection Assistant

## Project Overview
This project is a conceptual AI-based assistant designed to detect water leakages using prompt engineering and rule-based anomaly detection logic.

The system analyzes simulated water flow data and generates intelligent alerts using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Technologies Used
- Prompt Engineering
- Rule-based + AI Logic
- IBM Granite Large Language Model (conceptual)
- Simulated CSV data

## How It Works
1. Water usage data is provided as CSV input
2. AI analyzes flow patterns
3. Anomalies and leakages are detected
4. Alert messages are generated

## Prototype Type
Conceptual AI prototype with prompt-based workflows and simulated datasets.

## Demo
Sample input-output interactions are available in the `demo/` folder.
